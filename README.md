## HackUTD 8 : EOG Challenge

Before you read further, `YES` we didn't solve it in the optimal way. 
We think DP or memoization would have helped in improving the performance.
But then, we couldn't resolve to divide this into sub problems.

## The Plain Problem Statement
Removing all the javascript & frontend aspect, this problem boils down to
- Maximize profit
- Minimize flowRate
for each process points within the graph.

## Approach
1. Brute force (Back-tracking)
We are using backtracking to solve this.

3. Dynamic Programing
We think, DP would be a great solution, but we could'nt reduce this to sub-problems.
